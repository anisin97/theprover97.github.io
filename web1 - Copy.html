<h1><u>This one is very important and serious....</u></h1>
<h6>..and also underlined </h6>
<hr><hr>
<p>So, I am writing all this. It is very tiery</p>
<li><u>This is a quote..</u></li>
<blockquote>Our <b>deeds</b> are like <b>stones,</b><br>
Cast into the <b>pool</b> of <b>time.</b><br>
	Though they themselves may disappear,
<br>
But their <b>ripples</b> last <b>long...</b></blockquote>

<p><i>This is a quote** by Dantraaaz tremiiik....</i></p><h6>It's more like commentary..</h6>
<pre>         If the world is a *<b>monologue</b>......
		 then, our class is a
		      <b>dumb show</b>...
</pre>
<h6>with proper censors for our beloved pg13 audiences</h6>
<ui><i>is this nice??..</i></ui>
<b>Don't make me laugh</b>
<p>So, here is a test for different kinds of lists --></p>
<ol>
<li>-Item is Aloo Bhujiya..</li>
<li>-Item is Butter-Bite Biscuits</li>
<li>-Item is Cream Biscuits.</li>
<li>-Item is Kurkure.</li>
</ol>
<p>This was an <em>ordered</em> list. Now, I am wrirting an <em>unordered</em> list.</p>
<ul>
<li>This has a <i>"disc"</i> bulletin..</li>
</ul><ul type="square"><li> This has a <i>"square"</i> bulletin.</li></ul>
<ul type="circle"><li> This has a <i>"circle"</i> buetin.</li></ul>
<p>Now, let's try out changing the glyph or ordering type in unordered list.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li> Monday has length of 23 hours..</li>
<li> This is a joke, right</li></ol>
<ol type="i"><li> What is all this about??</li><li> Is there anything serious??</li><li>All these are just questions..</li>
</ol>
<p>By changing the start attribute in ol lists, we can start from anywhere in any type of glyph</p>
<ol type="a" start="5">
<li>So, what now??</li>
<li>Didn't you notice? This list started with an 'e'</li></ol>
<!-- Now something else -->

<p>Here I am going to illustrate the use of <b>Definition lists</b> ->></p>
<dl>
